# HAYAT website
[Link to hosted website](https://hayatmusic.com)

I'm running an electronic music label and wanted to have my own website to showcase the music and everything related to it such as: the bio, mixes, spotify previews etc..

This is developped with React in NextJS and a few libraries such as SASS, MUI and mongoose to handle MongoDB connection.
